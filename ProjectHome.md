This project is intended for the distribution of cluster-management-related trace data.

## Cluster workload traces ##
These are traces of workloads running on Google compute cells.

  * [ClusterData2011\_2](http://code.google.com/p/googleclusterdata/wiki/ClusterData2011_2) provides data from an 12k-machine cell over about a month-long period in May 2011.
  * TraceVersion1 is a short trace that describes a 7 hour period from one cell (cluster).
  * A [bibliography](http://code.google.com/p/googleclusterdata/wiki/Bibliography) of related work provides bibtex data for papers about or derived from these traces.

## ETA traces ##
These are [execution traces from ETA](ETAExplorationTraces.md) (Exploratory Testing Architecture), which is a testing framework that explores interactions between distrinbuted, concurrently-executing components.

## Notes ##
Let us know about issues or insights by [sending an email](mailto:googleclusterdata-discuss@googlegroups.com) to the  [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/googleclusterdata-discuss). (Please join it to keep up to date!)  The more specific the data, the more likely we are to be able to help you.

If you have (or generate) tools that help analyze or decode the trace data, please share them with others.  We'd be happy to host them on this site.  Ditto for the analyses themselves.
